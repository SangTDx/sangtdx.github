# Highlights

* An automotive-grade data-centric software framework that
optimizes cost, network distribution, safety and security
* Enables reliable, real-time data transport for next-generation
electrical/electronic zonal architecture components, from
ECUs to central and zonal gateways
* Supports broad integration of different automotive platforms
in a common architecture, including AUTOSAR Classic and
AUTOSAR Adaptive, ROS 2 and Time-Sensitive Networking
(TSN) support
* Provides a safety certification pathway to achieve up to ISO
26262 ASIL D compliance

# The Rise Of Next Gen E/E Zonal Architecture

**Zonal architecture is the name given to this new approach to vehicle electronics**

* The automotive industry is undergoing an unprecedented shift
as automotive manufacturers race to develop software-defined
vehicles (SDVs).
* This imperative has given rise to next gen E/E zonal architecture.
The central aspect of this trend is transitioning towards
consolidating vehicle computing capabilities for optimized cost,
power distribution, security, flexibility and weight.
* Connext Drive provides the data-centric software framework
needed to efficiently manage this complexity and integrate new
and evolving technologies to seamlessly support next gen E/E
zonal architecture in tomorrow’s autonomous vehicles.

# Achieving ECU Consolidation

* The combination of zonal architecture with Connext Drive
supports manufacturers who are trying to consolidate electronic
control units (ECUs) and domains into zones. Connext Drive
offers a variety of advantages for manufacturers engaged in
creating scalable and future-proof vehicle architecture. These
benefits include:

  * Product components that enable the given functionality
  for each vehicle zone: ECUs, central gateway and zonal
  gateway.
  * The simplification of the overall wiring harnesses (which is
  currently the third-highest component cost) through TSN
  support.
  * Support for communication libraries certified for systems
  up to ISO 26262 ASIL D.
  * Providing the only proven connectivity standard that is
  used by ROS 2, AUTOSAR Classic/OSEK and AUTOSAR
  Adaptive for autonomous vehicles.
  * Cost reduction, both in terms of components and labor,
  enabling manufacturers to prioritize overall scalability
  through a data-centric approach.
  * Building next-generation in-vehicle architecture despite
  unknown requirements, such as hardware, autonomous
  functionality and dynamic updates at deployment.
  * Evolving from legacy automotive products into new
  architectures that include ADAS and telematics
  applications, making it possible to compete in new
  markets with dedicated product offerings

# Delivering Interoperability

* Because modern vehicles often include over 100 ECUs,
manufacturers are well aware of the interoperability challenges
posed by ECUs and the need to integrate, simplify and free up
space under the hood for new functionality. 
* Connext Drive reflects the capabilities of proven software
communication framework and the commitment to support the
collocation of different technologies: It can operate natively
based on the Data Distribution Service (DDS™) standard, or by
providing direct integrations within ROS 2, AUTOSAR Classic
and AUTOSAR Adaptive.
* The DDS standard is part of the AUTOSAR Adaptive
specification, opening up the platform to a whole new level of
integration to help OEMs meet the demanding requirements at
the zonal gateway level. The Connext® Integration Toolkit
for AUTOSAR Classic bridges AUTOSAR Adaptive to Connext
Drive. It supports automatic conversion of data type definitions
across standard formats (OMG® IDL, OMG DDS-XML and
AUTOSAR ARXML), as well as the generation of supporting C
code for data conversion and marshaling between the Runtime
Environment (RTE) and DDS communication frameworks.
