### What is the Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA)??

* The FOTA application allows vehicle ECU firmware to be updated in the background. The FOTA gateway is physically connected with in-vehicle networking and has the ability to communicate with ECUs capable of FOTA updating; and it is typically the controller that performs firmware updating management for the whole vehicle.
